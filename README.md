# Supernova 1a MCMC Sampling

The sample file jla_mub.txt contains n = 31 pairs of redshift and distance modulus (z,Î¼), corresponding to bins containing supernovae with z < 1.3

The sample file jla_mub_covmatrix.txt contains 31 x 31 covariance matrix of the data, provided as a list of numbers in single column order.

Use both of the uploaded files to extract information for about 700 supernova.
